# CMO-Critical-Minerals-Ontology-
CMO (Critical Minerals Ontology) is an ontology of the critical minerals system based on the CMMI's Deposit Classification Scheme. 
The OWL code for the Critical Minerals Ontology (CMO.owl) and the Jupyter notebook (CMO.ipynb) for the query system are both available here on GitHub. Users who intend to extend the CMO ontology first need to download the CCO (Common Core Ontologies) master folder (https://github.com/CommonCoreOntology) and then save the CMO.owl and ro.owl files in the CCO master folder. Users who intent to run the query system need to install the freely available Owlready2 folder (https://us01.z.antigena.com/l/_leA2Knm44nJxyiNk9e~6MoRBTw-wu1xDUT-_FVqaP5L2ZsY6wKWhX6GNLa_V~ba02so6wh6JGgqc4m0eKVW7SEgUAJYnr~PR0gzznMtw50hIQiKXBEl4nhyIt9f9T42UQod4SbQQWubkPwdq2hb9QKGTLS2~Hb_gocD_M7ZqvgRMRcLOPONBd21NVfJ62HOh4RMUttk8m ) and save it in their user folder under ‘C:\Users’. The CCO folder (containing the CMO.owl) and the CMO.ipynb notebook must be saved in the Owlready2 folder. The query system can be run on the user’s computer server (localhost) by opening the CMO.ipynb Jupyter notebook which references the CMO.owl ontology and runs the query system.
